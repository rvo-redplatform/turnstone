"""Output guard — heuristic evaluation of tool execution results.

Facet 2 of the three-facet intent validation system.  The judge (Facet 1)
evaluates tool calls BEFORE execution.  The output guard evaluates tool
RESULTS AFTER execution but BEFORE they enter the conversation context.

All checks run in priority order within a wall-clock time budget.  If the
budget is exhausted, the assessment is returned with whatever flags have
been collected so far.  The guard annotates but never gates — callers
decide how to act on the assessment.

Performance target: <30s wall clock (configurable).  Default raised from
5s to 30s in 1.6 to give expanded pattern sets (camouflage detection
added per arXiv:2605.22001) headroom on large tool outputs.  Operators
tune via ``judge.output_guard_budget_seconds``.  Dependencies: stdlib only.
